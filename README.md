# Single Hotswap for IntelliJ ![](.artwork/intellij.png)

### Download from [IntelliJ Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14832-single-hotswap)

With this plugin you can hotswap **way faster** than usual by hotswapping **only the file opened** in the editor.<br>
The builtin feature of Intellij "Compile and Reload" always reloads every single file that is referenced by the target class.<br>
Therefore, this plugin gives you a better control what exactly you want to hotswap.

*It will provide a blue hammer next to the green "Build Project" hammer.*
